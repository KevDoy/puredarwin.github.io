See the [changelog](https://github.com/PureDarwin/PureDarwin/commits/main/) for the history of commits made on Github.

PureDarwin is currently working on AHCI/NVMe and eMMC family/drivers for Darwin, only they will not support/work on Apple's macOS. We have a PoC (Proof of Concept) of a PureDarwin 17.6 QEMU image that's based on Apple's open source code of [macOS 10.13.3](https://opensource.apple.com/release/macos-10133.html) that's only currently available to devs who join our IRC channel (#puredarwin on Freenode). 

**Update:** Hey, guys, we're still moving along. We'll be providing an SDK that is native of an Apple release on opensource.apple.com and a modified version that is PureDarwin targeted, as we are working on a modified XNU kernel with some other BSD/POSIX features that don't require us to rely on Apple's closed sources that they'll never release.

We are looking for supporters/coders that can help bring about faster development of PureDarwin while showing Apple that there is still a community of open source Darwin supporters that would like to see more open-ness from them, whether it be from them releasing binary drivers for our use as they once did, or open source projects like libxpc/launchd again.
