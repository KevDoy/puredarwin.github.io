[Darwin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darwin_%28operating_system%29) is the open source operating system from Apple that forms the base for macOS, iOS, tvOS, etc.

PureDarwin is a community project to make Darwin more usable on its own (some people think of it as the informal successor to OpenDarwin).

One current goal of this project is to provide a useful bootable ISO of Darwin.
Another goal of this project is to provide additional documentation. [More](/about/_About)...
