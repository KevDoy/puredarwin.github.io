[Darwin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darwin_%28operating_system%29) is the open source operating system from Apple that forms the base for macOS, iOS, tvOS, etc.

PureDarwin is a community project to make Darwin more usable on its own (some people think of it as the informal successor to OpenDarwin).

One current goal of this project is to provide a useful bootable ISO of Darwin.
Another goal of this project is to provide additional documentation. [More](/about/_About)...

## Status

As of 2024, PureDarwin remains an active open-source project aimed at making Darwin, the core of macOS, into a standalone operating system. The community is working on [PureDarwin PD-17.4](https://github.com/PureDarwin/PD-17.4-Beta), a minimal system distributed primarily as a virtual machine disk (VMDK) that can run in environments like QEMU. This release focuses on providing a development platform independent of macOS components, but it lacks a GUI and has limited hardware and network driver support due to the absence of proprietary macOS parts.

While progress is steady, PureDarwin continues to depend on community contributions to address missing components and improve system usability. Documentation efforts are ongoing, and developers are encouraged to contribute on [GitHub](https://github.com/PureDarwin/PureDarwin). A community discussion space on [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/9kz8XXRRcT) is also available for support and collaboration.
